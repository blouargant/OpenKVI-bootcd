Building a new ISO image:
------------------------

- Go to "tools" directory of the target Operating System (eg system/6.5/rhel/os/x86_64/tools)
- Select the ISO profile you want to create (eg ncx)
  use "./iso-tools -l" command to list available ISO profiles.
- Checkout the releasenote in ./profiles/<profile>/releasenote.txt
  make the appropriate modifications.
  The first "VERSION:" entry will be used as the ISO image version.
  This version should use the Operating System version (eg 6.5) as the first two digits.
- Launch ISO image creation:
  ./iso-tools -p <profile> 
  the ISO image will be created in ../../../iso/<arch>/
  A MD5 file is also created for intigrity checking.
